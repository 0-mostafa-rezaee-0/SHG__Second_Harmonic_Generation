# Codes and Results  

This folder contains the source codes (in `.f90`) and their corresponding results for several simulations described in our previously published articles, uploaded in `0. Cite US`. Each code file corresponds to a particular modeling scenario, while the numbered folders (`2_Results`, `3_Results`, etc.) contain the output data, figures, or post-processed results generated by those codes.
