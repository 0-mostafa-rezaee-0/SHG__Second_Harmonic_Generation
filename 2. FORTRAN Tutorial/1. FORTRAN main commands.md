# FORTRAN main commands

# Variables
Variables in Fortran are divided into four categories: Integer, Real, Character, and Logical.

```
Integer  i
Real*8   p      ,q        ,r
```

# Calculation operations and their precedence
In Fortran, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations can be easily done with `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` symbols.
Note: Power operations are performed with the `**` symbol
The precedence of operations in Fortran is as follows:
1. Calculation of the expression inside the parentheses and library functions
2. Power
3. Multiplication and division
4. Addition and subtraction

# Structure of Fortran programs
A structure called General Structure is suggested for writing programs.
Note: The extension of the old programs written with Fortran was For, but the extension of the new Fortran program is F90.

# Data input
1. Data entry by the user
```
Read(*,*) x
```
2. Data entry by the programmer
```
Pi=3.14
```
- Complex numbers are written as ordered pairs:
Z = a + bi
(a,b)
```
Ii=(0.,1.)
```

# Program output
The `Write` command is used to print information on the screen. `,` should be placed between the variables that are to be printed.
```
Write(*,*) a,b
```

Note: In order for a phrase to be printed exactly, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.
```
Write(*,*)  ‘Result=‘ ,a 
```

If the goal is to print the output in a specific order, we should write a special type of operator instead of the * sign.

Important operators are also:
`X`: Blank space
`Fw.d`: Decimal number output with field length W and decimal value d
`L`: logical variable output
`Ew.d`: power number output with field length W and decimal value d
`Aw`: string output with field length w
`Im`: Integer output with field length m
`' '`: Whatever is placed inside the quotation marks will be printed exactly.
`/`: Moves the editor to the next line.
`\`: means to keep the cursor on the same line.

```
Write(*, '( operators )' ) outputs
```

`do` command:
- The `do` loop is written as follows:
```
Write(*,*)
Do  i=1,5,2
        Write(*, ‘(a, i2)’ ) ’i=‘ , i 
End  do     !i
```

- `do` and `exit` loop:
```
Write(*,*)
Do
      q=q+1
       write(*, ‘ ( a, f6.2) ’) ‘q=‘ ,q
       if  (q==5)  exit
End do    !i
```
- `do` & `While` loop:
```
Write(*,*)

Do while   (r<5)
       r=r+1
       write(* , ‘(a, f6.2)’) ’r=‘ ,r
End  do ! i
```

# Conditional commands
With the help of conditional commands, it is possible to execute a part of the program depending on the condition being established. The structure of this command is as follows:
```
If (a logical expression) executive command
```

The logical expression can be an equality condition or not. In the Fortran language, the following symbols are used to apply conditions:
```
.GE.  or  >=  greater than or equal to
.GT.  or  >   greater
.LE.  or  <=  less than or equal to
.LT.  or  <   smaller
.N.E. or  \=  inequality
.EQ.  or  ==  equal
```

Several conditions can be combined with each other with the help of the following factors:
```
.AND. The equivalent of "and" means that two conditions are met
.Or.  The equivalent of "or" means that at least one of the conditions is met
.Not. It means establishing a condition
```

# Arrays
Arrays are multidimensional variables. In fact, arrays are like one-row or multi-row matrices that can be assigned data according to the index of the corresponding row and column.

The following method is used to determine the dimensions of the arrays in the variable definition section:

To determine the number of assets of each dimension according to GS, we act as follows.

One dimensional (line)   

![Image2](0. Archive/images\2.JPG)

Two-dimensional (plane)   

![Image3](0. Archive/images\3.JPG)

Three-dimensional (volume)

![Image4](0. Archive/images\4.JPG)

Four dimensions
We must know that these titles have the authority of the address and from here on it cannot be simplified with a photo.

Note: The purpose of presenting the above content was to express this fact that the rows can be zero, negative and even decimal, but the step is the same.


# Operations on arrays
Arrays can be used like matrices, which means that arrays can be added, subtracted, multiplied, etc.
```
A=B+C    ;     D=A*E
```
Using arrays
- Enter data according to a specific formula such as i*j
```
Do  i=1,2
      do  j=1,3
             A( i,j)=i*j
      end do   ! j
End do  ! i
```
- Getting information from the user
```
Read(*,*) A(i,j)
```
- Getting information from file 1 to perform the next action
```
Read(1,*) A(i,j)
```

# Files

If the program's input information or its output results are large, the file can be used to easily read the information or output. The information can be put in a new file with the help of programming software and then save the file.

To create or call information from a file, the following command should be written:
```
Open (file number, File='file name')

Read(file number, *) a,b,...
```

The following commands can also be used to print the output on a file:
```
Open (file number, File=' Desired name for the results file')

Write(file number, *) outputs
```

Note 1: Each time using the command, Read(file number,*) a line is read from the information file. In fact, with free format, information is read from the next line every time. (This command can be used to skip lines.)

```
Read(1,*)
```

Note 2: In the information file, it is necessary to have at least one empty space between them to separate the data.

Tip 3: Usually lines are written in the data file to guide the user. So that these lines are not read by the main program and the program skips them, it is enough to write the following command once for each explanatory line.

```
Read(file number,*)
```

Note 4: with each time the following command can create results or an empty line in the output file.
```
Write(file number,*)
```

Note 5: The file number is actually a temporary number to separate the files from each other.

Note 6: If the type (either integer, real or string) or the number of variables in the input file has the slightest difference with the type or number of variables that are read by the Read command, it will cause general and minor problems in the performance or correctness of the program. became.


# Close the file
The following command is used to close the file:

```
Close (file number)
```

# Resume reading information in a file
If a file is in use and it is requested that the control of the line be sent to the beginning of it so that the reading of the information can be done again from the beginning, the following command is used:

```
Rewind (file number)
```

If the goal is to return line control to one or more previous lines in the data file, the following command can be executed as many times as necessary:

```
Backspace (file number)
```

# Library functions
In order to simplify programming, many functions are defined by the Fortran language, which the user can use just by writing their names.

| Function | Description | 
|--------|--------| 
| ABS(a) | It calculates the absolute value of the number a. |  
| AINT(a) | It removes the decimal part of the number a, but the result is still a real number. |  
| ANINT(a) | Rounds the real number a. |  
| NINT(a) | rounds the real number a and the result will be a whole number (by removing the decimal point) | 
| INT(a) | It converts the real number a into an integer by removing its decimal part. |  
| Real(N) | Converts integer N to real type. With this, the number N can be received as a decimal. | 
| SIN(a),COS(a),TAN,COTAN(a) | They calculate the sine, cosine, tangent and cotangent of the number a respectively. |  
| ASIN(a),ACOS(a),TAN,ATAN(a) | They calculate the inverse of sine, cosine, tangent and cotangent of the number a. | 
| SINH(a),COSH(a),TANH(a) | They calculate the sine, cosine, and hyperbolic tangent of the number a, respectively. |  
| EXP(a)| Equivalent to $e^{a}$ | 
| LOG(a) | Equivalent to Ln(a) |  
| Log10(a) | Equivalent to Log(a) |  
| SQRT(a) | is equivalent to $\sqrt{a}$, Explanation: To calculate the nth root of a number, you should write $a^{\frac{1}{n}}$ |
| MAX(a,b,…) | The result of this function will be the maximum number of its input. |  
| MIN(a,b,…) | The result of this function will be the minimum of its input numbers. |  
| MOD(a,b) | Calculates the remainder of the correct division of a by b. |  
| CALL RANDOM(a) | Assigns a random value between 0 and 1 to the number a |  
| CALL GETTIM (Ih,Im,Is,Il00th) | Receives the time with an accuracy of hundredths of a second. After executing this command, Ih, Im, Is, and Il00th are respectively equal to hours (1 to 24), minutes, seconds, and hundredths of seconds (in the form of whole numbers). |  
| CALL SETTIM (Ih,Im,Is,Il00th) | If the correct variables Ih, Im, Is, and Il00th have values, they record the new time. |  
| GETDAT (Iyr, Imon, Iday) | After executing this command, the year, month, and day will be recorded in the Iyr, Imon, and Iday variables. |   
| SETDAT (Iyr, Imon, Iday) | The new year, month and day values will be recorded on the device. |  

# Creating a function
To perform calculations or operations that do not exist in Fortran, the corresponding function can be defined and used in the following two ways.

## Method 1: Definition of a one-sentence function
The easiest way to define a function is to write the relevant relation after non-executable commands (such as integer, Data, etc.) and before executable commands (such as Read, etc.). In the use of one-sentence functions, it is better that the name of the function is not the same as the name of the internal Fortran functions.

```
Real a,b,c
F(x,y,z)=(x+y+z)**2
Read(*,*)a,b,c
Write(*,*)f(a,b,c)
end
```

Note: As can be seen in the example above, the variables used for the function are only important in terms of their placement order, and changing their names does not cause any problems in the application.

## The second method: defining the function using the Function command
If the function defined by the user is long, it is better to define it as a function. For this, the function is written with the Function command after the main program. Calling the function in the text of the main program is done only by writing it.

```
Read(*,*)a,b,c
Write(*,*)f(a,b,c)
end
```
```
Function F(x,y,z)
C1=(x+y)**2
C2=(x+z)**2
C3=(y+z)**2
F=(c1+c2+c3)**2
end
```

Note: The name of the function in the Function subprogram must be used without including its variables. That is, using F(x,y,z) instead of F will cause an error.

# Programming tips

- Incremental sum:  
For the incremental addition of several data, you can proceed in a similar way to the following example:

```
Sum=0
Do i=1,n
     sum=sum+A(i)
End do
```

- Successive multiplication:   
A method like the following example is used for successive multiplication of several data:

```
P=1
Do    i=1,n
         p=p*A(i)
End do
```

- Character data binding:  
Expressions are assigned to character variables either through the Read command or with the `=` sign. `//` operator can be used to connect two or more character variables (or data) to each other.

```
Character name1*10, name2*10, text*20
Name1=‘Carl’
Name2=‘Taylor’
Text=name1//name2
Write(*,*)text
```

Output:
```
Carl Taylor
```

If we want to delete the unoccupied remainder of the field of a character variable. So that it is only limited to the occupied characters, we must use the Trim command. In the previous program, if the Text variable is defined in the following way, the output will be properly and with only one space between two words.

```
Text=trim(name1)//’ ‘//trim(name2)
```

Output:
```
Carl Taylor
```
